## 38. Count and Say

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/)

**Analysis:**  
1. This is an inductive process. The *(k+1)*th reading depends on the *k*th reading.  
2. The starting point of the induction is the first reading, which we set as `seq="1"`.  
3. We need to recursively update `seq` *n-1* times.  
4. For each update, we use `list` to record the list of letters in the previoius `seq`. Starting with the first element `a=list[0]`, we count how many times `a` appears in the head of `list`, and record the number by `l`. In the process we also remove `a` in the head of `list`. Then we record the str `str(l)+a` in the list `stack`. Continue until we exhaust `list`, that is, when the length of `list` becomes 0.  In the last step we concatenate the strings in `stack` to form the new `seq`.   
5. Return `seq` which is the *n*th reading.

```
class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:
        
        seq = "1"
        if n >= 2:
            for k in range(0,n-1):
                list = [i for i in seq]
                stack = []
                while len(list) > 0:
                    a = list[0]
                    l = 0
                    while len(list) > 0 and a == list[0]:
                        l += 1
                        list.remove(a)
                    stack.append(str(l)+a)
                    
                seq = ''.join(stack)
        return seq
```

## 70. Climbing Stairs

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

**Analysis:**

1. This is again a recursive process.   
2. In order to climb *n+1* stairs, one has exactly two possibilities for the previous step: either one reach the *n*th stair, or one reach the *(n-1)*th stair. Thus if we denote by `a(k)` the number of different ways to climb *n* stairs, then we have `a(n+1)=a(n)+a(n-1)` (here we need to assume `n-1>0`). This is the inductive formula!
3. Set up the initial terms `a(0)=a(1)=1` and use the above inductive formula, we can easily get it done via a simple `for` loop.

```
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        a = [1,1]
        for k in range(0,n):
            a.append(a[k]+a[k+1])
            
        return a[n]
```

**Remark:** If one realizes that this is actually the Fibonacci sequence, he could choose to use the explict formula as in [Wikipedia: Fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).

## 344. Reverse String

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)

**Analysis:** Use `head` to store the head of the unchanged part of the list, and use `tail` to store the tail. Then exchange their positions.

```
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
       
        L = (len(s)+1)//2
        for k in range(0, L):
            head = s[k]
            tail = s[-k-1]
            s[k] = tail
            s[-k-1] = head

```
## 58. Length of Last Word

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/)

**Analysis:** First use the `.strip()` method to remove any empty space in the beginning and in the end of the string. Then count how many non-empty letters in the tail (from right to left) until we reach to the first empty space.

```
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        k = 0
        stripped = s.strip()       
        while k <= len(stripped)-1:
            if stripped[-k-1] != " ":
                k += 1
            else:
                return k
        
        return k
```

## 231. Power of Two

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

**Analysis:** One can of course do it in a recursive fashion, that is, divide `n` by 2, check the remainder: if it is non-zero, stop and return `False`; otherwise, update `n=n/2` and repeat. If in the end we get `n=1`, return `True`.

However there is an clever one-liner using the bitwise operations such as `&` and `|`:

```
class Solution:
    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n>0 and n&(n-1) == 0
```

For a good explaination of the Python bitwise operators, see [Here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/bitwise_operators_example.htm). So the idea of the above solution is: if `n<=0`, return `False`. For the second part, `n&(n-1)==0`, any positive integer `n` is represented uniquely as a sequence of bits, that is, `1`s and `0`s. However, `n` is a power of 2 if and only if the bit form of `n` looks like `10...0`, where there is only a leading `1`, and the rest are all 0s.  In that case, the bit form of `n-1` is `01..1`. Therefore the bitwise *and* operator `n&(n-1)` will give a sequence of 0s, since at each corresponding position for the bit forms of `n` and `n-1`, there is always a `0` and a `1`. Meanwhile, if `n` is not a power of 2, then in the bit form of `n`, there are at least two `1`s, say `...1...1...`. A moment thinking will lead to the conclusion that the bit form of `n-1` will have `1` in the first position, as `...1...*...`, therefore the outcome of `n&(n-1)` is never 0!


## 217. Contains Duplicate

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)

**Analysis:** Change the list to set, then compare the lengths of the list and the set.

```
class Solution:
    def containsDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        return len(set(nums)) != len(nums)
``` 
## 204. Count Primes

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/)

**Analysis:**  

1. Build a logic list `res` to store whether the integers for 0 to n-1 are prime or not.
2. Initial conditions: 0 and 1 are not primes, so set the first two elements in `list` to be `False`, while set the third element (which corresponds to 2) to be `True`.
3. Using a `for` loop, we update the list `res`: if `i` is a prime, then `2*i`, `3*i`, etc. are all non-prime.
4. We count how many `True` are in `res`. 

```
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
            if n <= 2:
                return 0
            res = [True] * n
            res[0] = res[1] = False
            for i in range(2, n):
                if res[i] == True:
                    for j in range(2, (n-1)//i+1):
                        res[i*j] = False
            return sum(res)
```

## 263. Ugly Number
[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/)

**Analysis:**

1. If `num` is strictly greater than 1, we keep trying to reduce it, by dividing `num` by `2,3,5`, if divisible.
2. We use the logic variable `ugly` to track whether `num` is divisible by `2,3,5` or not.

```
class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, num: int) -> bool:
        while num > 1:
            ugly = False
            for k in [2,3,5]:
                if num % k == 0:
                    ugly = True
                    num = num/k
            if not ugly:
                return ugly
        return num == 1
```


## 202. Happy Number

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

**Analysis:** 

1. Use a list called `history` to store the history of numbers we obtain. The variable `tail` is the current last element in `history`.

2. If `tail` is not 1, we continue the process to add numbers to `history`.

3. Each time we add an element to `history`, we check whether this element has appeared before. If so, then we will get an infinite loop, so we stop the loop.

4. Once we break the loop, we check whether `tail` is 1 or not. If 1, then this number is happy; otherwise, it is an unhappy number.

```
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        history = [n]
        tail = n
        while tail != 1:
            l = [int(i)**2 for i in str(tail)]
            tail = sum(l)
            history.append(tail)
            if len(history) > len(set(history)):
                break
        
        return tail == 1
```    
## 268. Missing Number

[Link to the problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/)

**Analysis:** Sort the list first, then compare the position `k` with its value `nums[k]`.

```
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        for k in range(0,len(nums)):
            if nums[k] == k:
                k += 1
            else:
                break
        return k
```

Another direct solution (kinda cheating imo):

```
class Solution:
    def missingNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        N = len(nums)
        return N(N+1)/2 - sum(nums)
```
