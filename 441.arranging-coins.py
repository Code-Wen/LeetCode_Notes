# Testcase Example:  '5'
#
# You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where
# every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
# ⁠
# Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
# 
# n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed
# integer.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# n = 5
# 
# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤
# 
# Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# n = 8
# 
# The coins can form the following rows:
# ¤
# ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤ ¤
# ¤ ¤
# 
# Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

        res = int(sqrt(2*n))
        while res*(res+1) > 2*n:
            res -= 1
        return res
