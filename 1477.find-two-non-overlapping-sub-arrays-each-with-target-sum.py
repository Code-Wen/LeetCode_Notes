#
# Given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
# 
# You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with sum equal
# target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the
# sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
# 
# Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or
# return -1 if you cannotÂ find such two sub-arrays.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their
# lengths is 2.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7
# ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as
# the sum of their lengths is 2.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
# Output: -1
# Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
# 
# 
# Example 4:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [5,5,4,4,5], target = 3
# Output: -1
# Explanation: We cannot find a sub-array of sum = 3.
# 
# 
# Example 5:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [3,1,1,1,5,1,2,1], target = 3
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Note that sub-arrays [1,2] and [2,1] cannot be an answer because
# they overlap.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5
# 1 <= arr[i] <= 1000
# 1 <= target <= 10^8
# 
#
