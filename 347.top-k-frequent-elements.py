# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,2,2,3]\n2'
#
# Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
# Output: [1,2]
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1], k = 1
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# Note: 
# 
# 
# You may assume k is always valid, 1 â‰¤ k â‰¤ number of unique elements.
# Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is
# the array's size.
# It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top
# k frequent elements is unique.
# You can return the answer in any order.
