# Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of
# non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated
# sequence of one or more dictionary words.
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the
# segmentation.
# You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet
# code".
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple
# pen apple".
# Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
# Output: false
#
