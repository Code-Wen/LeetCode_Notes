#
# Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common
# subsequence.
# 
# A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string
# with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order
# of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while
# "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is
# common to both strings.
# 
# 
# 
# If there is no common subsequence, return 0.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
# Output: 3  
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
# 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
# The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

class Solution:
    def longestCommonSubsequence(self, text1: str, text2: str) -> int:
        
        # Make a grid of 0's with len(text2) + 1 columns 
        # and len(text1) + 1 rows.
        # dp_grid[i][j] = length of longest common subsequence text1[i:], text2[j:]
        dp_grid = [[0] * (len(text2) + 1) for _ in range(len(text1) + 1)]
        
        # Iterate up each column, starting from the last one.
        for col in reversed(range(len(text2))):
            for row in reversed(range(len(text1))):
                # If the corresponding characters for this cell are the same...
                if text2[col] == text1[row]:
                    dp_grid[row][col] = 1 + dp_grid[row + 1][col + 1]
                # Otherwise they must be different...
                else:
                    dp_grid[row][col] = max(dp_grid[row + 1][col], dp_grid[row][col + 1])
        
        # The original problem's answer is in dp_grid[0][0]. Return it.
        return dp_grid[0][0]
