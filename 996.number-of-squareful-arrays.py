# Testcase Example:  '[1,17,8]'
#
# Given an array A of non-negative integers, the array is squareful if for
# every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.
# 
# Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful.Â  Two permutations
# A1 and A2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that A1[i] !=
# A2[i].
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [1,17,8]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 
# [1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [2,2,2]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# 1 <= A.length <= 12
# 0 <= A[i] <= 1e9
#

class Solution:
    def numSquarefulPerms(self, A: List[int]) -> int:
        c = collections.Counter(A)
        cand = {i: {j for j in c if int((i + j)**0.5) ** 2 == i + j} for i in c}

        def dfs(x, left=len(A) - 1):
            c[x] -= 1
            count = sum(dfs(y, left - 1) for y in cand[x] if c[y]) if left else 1
            c[x] += 1
            return count
        return sum(map(dfs, c))
